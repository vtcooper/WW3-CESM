Vince Cooper, vcooper@uw.edu

Past changes from other branches include:
-w3srcemd.F90: Remove timesplitting numerical approach to integrating the S_ice source term.
-wave_comp_nuopc.F90: change dtmin to allow subcycling
-w3sic4md.F90: correction to alpha and WN_I factor of 2
-w3wavemd.F90: suppress write statements cluttering the log files
-Not in github: change to cice namelist user_nl_cice to use 'ml' wave solver

New changes for this branch include:
-w3srcemd.F90: force subcycling in SIC between 1% and 95%

Note: VTC original case named cesm23iw_dtice100.
This is the run used as model spin-up in Cooper et al. (2022), Wind waves... paper.
Run from 2000-2018 with subcycle of 100 seconds.
