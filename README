Past changes from other branches (rm_timesplit, enable_subcycle) include:
-w3srcemd.F90: Remove timesplitting numerical approach to integrating the S_ice source term.
-wave_comp_nuopc.F90: change dtmin to allow subcycling
-w3sic4md.F90: correction to alpha and WN_I factor of 2
-w3wavemd.F90: suppress write statements cluttering the log files
-Not in github: change to cice namelist user_nl_cice to use 'ml' wave solver

New changes for this branch include:
-wav_camp_nuopc.F90: reduced dtmin to 20 seconds (10 seconds slowed down model too much)
-w3sic4md.F90: manually changed IC4M8 (custom) to have attenuation of IC4Mx.
-w3srcemd.F90: S_in enhanced in ice

Note: VTC original case named cesm23iw_dtice100_w-nl-hf. Name is bad because this was
originally an experimental case. It should be named cesm23iw_ic4m2. Alas.

Model very rarely crashes. Solve it by reducing DTG in wav_comp_nuopc.F90, then run through
the problem timestep, then do a clean build and change DTG back to original value.
